I am a Senior Backend Software Engineer who thinks
in a structured way, communicates honestly, brings
their own ideas to the table and sees them through
to execution.

I started programming out of curiosity. I fell in love
with it when I saw the potential to solve a variety
of problems for myself and others. To me, software
engineering is about producing real value for people.

My expertise could be grouped into two complementary parts. There is the self-taught experimental
hacking, driven by the desire to just make things
work. Which is elevated through the educated professional craftsmanship, guided by the aspiration to produce clean code in structured and cooperative manner.

From the start I have always been driven to work on
real projects. Whenever the need arose, I built everything from APIs, complete Webapps and full-featured
command-line apps. With scripting I take this to another level. I automate any and all suitable menial
processes I come across to save time and standardize procedures. Both in my personal and professional
life.

I have multiple years of professional experience with
the integrated software engineering workflow (Working in a ticket-based environment, coordinating with
and directing a team of developers, PMs, QA and
other internal and external stakeholders.) I delivered
quality solutions and critical bug-fixes in a timely
manner. While doing so I always bring my own initiatives to the table that improve or automate process
and the environment, the technical docs and the developer experience.

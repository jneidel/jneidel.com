I am a Senior Backend Software Engineer who thinks
in a structured way, communicates honestly, is apt
as solving problems and brings their own ideas to the
table.

I started programming out of curiosity. I fell in love
with it when I saw the potential to solve a variety of
problems for myself and others. To me, programming
is fundamentally about solving technical problems.

My programming expertise could be grouped into two
complementary parts. There is the self-taught experimental hacking, driven by the desire to just make
things work. Which is elevated through the educated
professional craftsmanship, guided by the aspiration
to produce clean code in structured cooperative manner.

From the start I have always been working on personal projects. Building everything from APIs,
complete Webapps, small scripts and full-featured
command-line apps. The command-line especially is
a passion of mine as I do most of my work from the
terminal and text editor.

I have multiple years of professional experience with
the integrated software engineering workflow (Working in a ticket-based environment, coordinating with
and directing a team of developers, PMs, QA and
other internal and external stakeholders.) I delivered
quality solutions and critical bug-fixes in a timely
manner. While doing so I always bring my own initiatives to the table that improve or automate process
and the environment, the technical docs and the developer experience.

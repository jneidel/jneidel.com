All of the writing on this website is my own.
The writing was not and never will be partially or fully generated by an
AI/LLM tool.
All translations are also written by hand.

For research I use ChatGPT or [Claude.ai].
As input for editing I might occasionally use the above LLMs or [DeepL Write].
Most thumbnail images were generated by [Microsoft Designer] or ChatGPT.
OpenAI codex assists me in coding and debugging.

The [process of writing](project/writing-365) about gives me a
deeper understanding of the topic and forces me to structure my thoughts.
It's organized thinking.
Why would I derive myself of that?

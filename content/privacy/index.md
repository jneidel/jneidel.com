The topic of data protection is comprehensively regulated by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). To help you understand which data is collected from you, how it is processed, what is done for the protection of your data, I've put together all the relevant information on this page.

## Person responsible and scope
The person responsible according to the GDPR is:

Jonathan Neidel<br>
Bahnhofstr. 55<br>
03238 Rückersdorf<br>
E-mail: privacy@jneidel.com<br>
Website: https://jneidel.com

This privacy policy applies to my websites jneidel.de und jneidel.com.

## Principles of data processing
Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person. This includes, for example, information such as your name, age, address, phone number, date of birth, e-mail address, IP address, or user behavior. Information that we can not relate to your person (or only with disproportionate effort), e.g. by anonymizing the information, are not personal information. The processing of personal data (eg. collecting, querying, using, storing or transmitting) always requires a legal basis or your consent. Processed personal data will be deleted as soon as the purpose of the processing has been achieved and no legally required retention requirements have to be maintained.

If I process your personal data for the purpose of providing certain offers, I will subsequently inform you of the specific transactions, the scope and purpose of the data processing, the legal basis for the processing and the respective retention period.

## Usage of the websites

When using my websites visited paths, refer, user-agent and IP-address will be processed in anonymized form, so that I do not collect any personal data.

## Hosting

The websites and their contents are either hosted on my own infrastructure or at [uberspace](https://uberspace.de/).
See their [privacy policy](https://uberspace.de/en/about/privacy/).

## Logs

No logs are written.

## Usage of cookies

No cookies are used.

## Analytics

I use the open-source tool [Plausible](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) for anonymously collecting relevant data points about my websites usage.
See their [privacy policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) about which data is processed by Plausible.

## Links

I link to external websites.
When you visit a third-party website their data protection policy applies.
I have no control over third-party websites and therefore do not hold any responsibility for their contents or data processing.

## Embedded contents

I embed contents of third-parties.
Only once you click on a given widget will the contents be loaded for the given providers server.

### YouTube

For YouTube videos, without clicking only the thumbnail will be processed.
Once you click on the video, the whole module will be embedded and YouTube will process your data.
See the [privacy policy of Google](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

I am not my past.
Not my past mistakes or accomplishments.
<br>
I am not my future.
My promise or lack thereof.
<br>
I am not the things I own.

{{<lead>}}
I am, but the things I do.
{{</lead>}}

**I live in a small town.**

In the rural south of [Brandenburg][ee], in the middle of nowhere.
I live very close to a forest.
It's quiet and peaceful.

{{<figure src="./flaches-land.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Flat land, sun going down">}}

**I walk every day.**

Usually for one hour.
Sometimes less, often more.
I make heavy use of my local forest, which I mostly have to myself.

I wear barefoot shoes.
They are much more comfortable and support a healthy way of walking.

{{<figure src="./forest-walk.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Path in a forest">}}

**I exercise.**

My fitness is not at the level where I would like it to be.
Accordingly, my exercise routine is still a work in progress.
Currently I do:
- Sun salutations in the morning, as stretching and
to warm up my body (see: [challenge](newsletter/5#next-challenge) & [conclusions](newsletter/6#review-of-the-last-challenge))
- Kettlebell swings for strength
- [Trampoline jumping](/de/review/trampolinspringen){{<de>}} in between tasks

    {{<figure src="./kettlebells.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Kettlebells on a mat" caption="Kettlebells">}}
{{</center>}}
<!-- Additional Pics: downward dog form, me swinging kettlebell -->

**I prepare fresh meals daily.**

Theses are some principles I eat by:
- prefer unprocessed :left_right_arrow: avoid sugar and bad seed oils
- prefer uncooked
- aim for: min. 50% of a plates calories come from vegetables :arrow_right:
salad with every meal
- savory breakfast
- order matters[^right-order]
- keep blood sugar level in mind
- 16-8 [intermittent fasting](review/intermittent-fasting)

    {{<figure src="./groundnut-stew.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Groundnut Stew in Wok">}}
{{</center>}}

<!--TODO: uncooked ref Brucker-->
[^right-order]: The optimal order to consistent low blood sugar is: fiber, protein, carbs.

**I write.**

For this [website](project/writing-365). For myself.
Writing is thinking on paper.
It's part of every facet of my life.
I use it to build up an idea,
enhance my work output and the quality of my relationships,
deepen my understanding about something I read or heard,
communicate how something works or how I feel,
automate tasks by writing scripts[^shell].

95% of this writing happens digitally.
And the 5% that I write on paper are [digitized afterwards](/de/project/papierkram-digitalisieren).{{<de>}}

{{<figure src="./power-plant.png" class="w-12/12" alt="<++>" caption="An [essay](essay/power-plant)">}}

[^shell]: Meant are not shell-scripts, though I also write those:slightly_smiling_face:

**I do a [challenge](project/challenges) every week.**

This could be anything from trying
[visualizations](newsletter/6#next-challenge), experimenting and
understanding the tool [Neurostreams](review/neurostreams) or applying a
learning like "[eat the frog first](essay/eat-that-frog)" to my life.
This is an effort to integrate the things I read about into my life.

**I write a [newsletter](newsletter).**

It covers my weekly challenges and give readers an idea of what is going on
in my life in the absence of social media.

{{<figure src="./newsletter.png" class="w-12/12" alt="Beginning of a newsletter" caption="My [newsletter](newsletter/8)">}}

{{<newsletter-signup>}}

**I read non-fiction.**

Not as much as I used to, but much more purposefully now.
I get the most out of a book if I approach it with a question to be answered
or problem to be solved.

{{<figure src="./bookshelf.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Small bookshelf on a dresser with plants on top">}}

**I keep detailed personal accounting.**

Every euro I spend is accounted for[^except].
This allows me to do budgeting in virtual pots, irrespective of where my
money is actually stored[^ledger].
It's great for a quick overview and subsequent analysis.

{{<center>}}

{{</center>}}
<br>
{{<figure src="./ledger-food.png" class="w-12/12" alt="Expenditure on food over the last year" caption="Food expenses over a year">}}

[^except]: A few euros and cents go missing every month.
That is just an unavoidable outcome of transacting with cash a lot.
[^ledger]: I use [hledger](https://hledger.org/) as my accounting tool.

**I contribute to OpenStreetMap**

OSM is an open-sourced map of the world.
I add missing paths, amenities, details and fix speed limits.

    {{<figure src="./street-complete.jpg" class="w-11/12" alt="Street Complete with a few roads" caption="Mapping speed limits">}}
    {{<figure src="./vespucci.jpg" class="w-11/12" alt="View of a in Vespucci" caption="Mapping a playground">}}
{{</center>}}

**I track my time.**

Every minute is accounted for.
This makes me more conscious of what I am doing and a few other benefits.
A guide (why and how) will follow.

    {{<figure src="./exercise-over-time.jpg" class="w-11/12" alt="Time track analysis of exercise category">}}
{{</center>}}

**I spend time with my wife, friends and family.**

Because of where I live, face to face interactions are limited to multiple
times per month (except with my wife, of course :joy:.)
This is by design and in-line with my needs for social contact.
I like calls, so I have a few long ones every week, mostly while walking.

{{<figure src="./francis-and-i.jpg" class="w-12/12" alt="Francis and I">}}

**I am present.**

As much as I can be.
Inspired by [the Power of Now].
[Here are](newsletter/8#next-challenge) some of the things I do to be present.

<!-- Pic: ? -->

## Business

**I am employed as a Software Engineer.**

Three days a week I work on a Symfony-based (PHP) project, on the same team
as my wife.
I work on maintenance tasks: bug fixing, code/performance improvements,
documentation.
Improving our API documentation is my current focus.
In the big previous project, I completely overhauled the technical
documentation.

<!-- Pic: screenshot api docs in nelmio config -->

**I co-run [JobDirecto](https://www.jobdirecto.com/).**

Together with [Wilfredo](https://wilfredocasas.com/).
I oversee the technical direction and do full-stack development.

    {{<figure src="./jobdirecto.png" class="w-12/12" alt="JobDirecto homepage">}}
{{</center>}}

## Computer

**I maintain my note-taking system.**

I have built-up an elaborate [note-taking system](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/)[^org]
for myself, which requires regular maintenance.
Every week I wipe the slate clean.
I go through all new emails, notes, unread messages, GitHub notifications,
the downloads directory, accumulated paper scraps and remove or file them in
accordance to my system.

{{<figure src="./org.png" class="w-12/12" alt="Home screen of my note-taking system" caption="The way I interact with my note-taking system.">}}

[^org]: My note-taking system is based on regular text files and uses
combination of lf, neovim and many custom scripts to fit my needs.
See my [dotfiles](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles) for details.
Then I [sync](guide/sync-notes) the files to all my devices.
Away from my laptop I create notes through Signal, from where they are
directly [imported](https://github.com/jneidel/signal-cli-to-file) into my system.

**I continuously update and enhance [my Linux setup](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles).**

I built up a system tailored specifically to my preferences and needs and [I add improvements](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles/releases)
regularly (whenever I find a better way to do something.)

I use the terminal for many things.
Because of it's potential to be automated and customized it is my preferred
way to interact with a computer.

{{<figure src="./terminal.png" class="w-12/12" alt="My linux setup" caption="Writing and file management in my terminal.">}}

**I [maintain](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages?O=0&SeB=M&K=jneidel&outdated=&SB=p&SO=d&PP=50) a few software packages.**

These packages make it easier for users to install software on their system.

{{<figure src="./aur-package.png" class="w-12/12" alt="PKGBUILD of an AUR package" caption="The <a href='https://aur.archlinux.org/cgit/aur.git/tree/PKGBUILD?h=phpactor'>PKGBUILD</a> file describes how a software package is to be installed by the OS.">}}

**I [torrent](dev/transmission-wireguard).**

In order of frequency: audiobooks, books, music, manga, movies,
documentaries and courses.
In self-managing my media I can tailor the experience much more to my
preferences.

    {{<figure src="./jellyfin.png" class="w-12/12" alt="Screenshot of Jellyfin" caption="My own streaming service">}}
{{</center>}}

**I administrate a sever at home.**

Through it I provide useful services to myself and my extended environment.
Services include media streaming, Dropbox-like [file sync](guide/sync-notes), document
management, [video processing](dev/transcoding), website analytics and many
little helper functions[^apps].

{{</center>}}

## Projects

**I'm working on a stock market strategy.**

To achieve consistent returns, with the money I've put aside.
[Project definition](/de/project/börsenstrategie/){{<de>}}
Right now I am:
- Cleaning up my notes and extracting the principles of the field.
- Doing some work on my mindset.
- Engaging with a local community of people doing the same things.
- Soon, I'm attending a workshop series of a guy presenting the strategies
that he profiably employs (option selling, Stillhaltergeschäfte.)

**Moving to Emacs**

Last year I became aware of some problems with my [Neovim](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles#neovim-terminal-editor) setup.[^nvimprob]
[Emacs](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles#emacs-editor) presented itself as the solution.
All my concerns addressed.
The migration of all of my workflows is a big project though.
Now, I'm in the process of first moving my note-taking over, followed by
some programming tasks.

[^nvimprob]: Stuff continuously broke on updates.
I didn't have the ability to tweak things how I liked them (not down to the
details that I wanted.)
There were some quirks that I could simply not get rid of.
I felt like I had with Manjaro Linux.
Emacs, just like Arch, presented a vision which could address all
of the problems that came about through a lack of extensibility and
customizability.

<!-- **I'm defining my purpose.** -->
<!---->
<!-- I'm in the process of defining my long-term goals. -->
<!-- I want to change the world for the better, in a way that is aligned with my -->
<!-- strengths and needs. -->
<!-- Finding my purpose has been a journey of personal discovery. -->
<!-- While I'm not there yet, I have a much clearer image of who I am and where -->
<!-- I'm going. -->

## What I don't do

I purposefully do not do things that would have a strong negative impact on
my life.

- alcohol
- video games
- social media
- the news
- TV/YouTube
- worrying
- complaining
- negative discouraging people

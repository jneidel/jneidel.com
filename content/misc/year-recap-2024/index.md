I wrote this for myself to to reflect on my successes over the course of the
year.
I'm sharing it only to give you some insights into what I was up-to.
Do not compare yourself to other people.
Everybody is on their own journey and should only compare themselves to
their past self, which is also what I do here.

## Context

I started into the year with a major down.
I had faced some setbacks at the end of last year and they carried over into
January/February.
In my interpretation, these setbacks were caused by mental barriers and a
lack of purpose and self-acceptance.
In December that had lead me giving up on a big project and brought on
self-doubt about my ability to enact change more generally.

## Finance

The big project was about trading the stock market.
I realized I had some limiting beliefs about money.
But what beliefs exactly?
And how do I get rid of them?

I did come to recognize and work through the major limiting beliefs.
That's 'money isn't easy to come by', remnants of 'rich = bad' and a very
personal one: 'I will be crushed by the responsibilities that comes with
wealth.'

I found many ways to deal with limiting beliefs, but searching for a more
effective one I found [NLP](misc/what-is-nlp) and did my [practitioner](/de/review/nlp23){{<de>}}.

After I overcoming these hurdles, I did make some progress towards stock
market gains.
I started to really engage with a local group of investors and nailed down
[what I am looking for](/de/project/b√∂rsenstrategie){{<de>}}.

I incorporated my entrepreneurial activities into a company to get used to
having my own business and to play around with tax optimizations.

## Health

I started doing [intermittent fasting](review/intermittent-fasting) consciously and consistently.

I seriously pursued pull-ups for a few month, added sun salutations to my
regular routine (see: [challenge](newsletter/5#next-challenge) &
[conclusions](newsletter/6#review-of-the-last-challenge) and added regular
kettlebell swings recently.

Towards the end of the summer I made the complete switch over to barefoot
shoes.
I had gotten my first pair last year and after wearing it in the forest
consistently my feet built up the necessary muscles.
The event that made me want to switch all my shoes to barefoot was visiting
a [barefoot park](https://derbarfusspark.de/), after which it was so painful go to back into my 'normal' shoes.
I proceeded to replace all of my shoes.

## Work and passion

I worked towards discovering my purpose.
I sketched out my perfect day, did Simon Sinek's why workshop together with
I my wife and wrote list of things I dislike, on basis of which a list of
things I do want was constructed.
I would not say that I now know my 'one purpose', but I do have an effective
compass, which helps me determine if an opportunity is in line my purpose.

One of those projects that was aligned with my purpose was this website.
I've had a website for a long time, but it wasn't easy to work with it, the
styling had room for improvement and it was missing many essential features.
So I rebuilt the site to my specifications added the many little details I
wanted and filled it with articles.

I started my challenge of [writing every day](project/writing-365), in an
effort get better at it and to create some articles for the site.
The quality, clarity and structure of my writing did increase noticeably.

With new vigor, I picked my [weekly challenges](project/challenges) up again.
Tweaked the format and at some point turned it into a weekly [newsletter](newsletter).

To allow me to do all of these projects, I reaffirmed my continuous
commitment to consuming a minimum of media.
In 2023 I had an incredibly productive run over the summer, which I do
attribute in part to almost zero consumption of sugar and audio-visual
media.
I could successfully reproduce some of the effects, especially in the
department of intrinsic motivation.

It wasn't all uphill, though.
I had my setbacks and down periods, but I learned my lessons from them and a
newfound sense of self-acceptance lessened their impact on my trajectory.

### On the job

My lobbying efforts paid off.
Work conditions much improved for everybody on our team through a split
into more manageable team sizes and the addition of a dedicated operations
person.

Documentation was a big topic.
I implemented a cohesive framework to unite our technical documentation in
one place, setup the processes and got the ball rolling to add the missing
sections.
Our API documentation was next.
A lot of work was done to fix up the foundations and in the documentation of
calls and properties.

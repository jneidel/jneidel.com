NLP means a lot of things to a lot of people.
There are many ways to define it.
I will try to give you a sense of what NLP is at it's core.

## The acronym

Often, NLP is "explained" by just dropping the expanded form of the acronym
and leaving it at that.
Like that's the ultimate truth.
(To be fair, I've done that :smile:.)

"**N**euro **L**inguistic **P**rogramming" is what Richard Bandler came up
with, because at the time, he had Neurology, Linguistics and Programming
text books in front of him.
Yes, NLP is concerned with how the brain works (Neurology) and uses words
(Linguistics) to program the mind.
But what does this actually mean?

## The founder

Richard Bandler, the co-founder of NLP, describes the field in a few
different ways.

> NLP is a user manual for your brain.

> It's the **study of the structure of conscious thought** and how it
  influences you.<br>
> The conscious mind and the way we think determines how our Neurology
  functions and how we build neurocotical pathways.<br>
> It's all about using language itself, either on you or another person, to
  change Neurology to **build permanent solutions to problems**.

NLP is more than the techniques that come out of it:

> NLP is an **attitude** and a **methodology** that leaves a trail of techniques
behind.

The mentioned attitude <q>is an insatiable curiosity about human beings</q>.

> NLP is the study of the structure of subjective experience and what can be
calculated from it.

It explores how the brain works subjectively and aims to elicit working
strategies and formulates them into useful techniques – better ways to use
your brain, as measured by the outcomes one would like to achieve.

## My teachers

These are some quote from my [Practitioner](/de/review/nlp23){{<de>}}.
Their definitions focus on the freedoms that NLP gives you, when you apply
it to your life.

> NLP is freedom.
  <br>– Alexander Hartmann

> NLP bedeutet, die **Freiheit** zu haben, in jedem Moment deines Lebens durch
  deine Gedanken **entscheiden zu können**, wie die Welt auf dich wirkt und wie du
  auf die Welt wirken kannst.
  <br>– Vanessa Buchner

<summary>English translation</summary>
<blockquote>
  NLP means to have the freedom to decide, in every moment of your life
  through your thoughts, how the world affects you and how you can affect
  the world.
</blockquote>

> NLP is the part of psychology that works.
  <br>– Christian Goebel

This hints at the history of NLP.
In the early development of NLP, Bandler and Grinder (the founders) modeled
the strategies of psychologists, who could reliably achieve successful
outcomes.
They created simple but powerful techniques out of those strategies, which
effectively can be used for getting rid of phobias, trauma, etc.

Since then, Bandler and Grinder have gone their own ways, but both agree
that modelling is the real key to NLP.

## Mine

Instead of a definition, I have a set of questions, which NLP provides the
answers for.

- How do I let go of a memory/picture[^memory] or a sound[^sound] that has
been plaguing me?
- How do I get into a desired state[^desired-state]?
- How do I get rid of a fear/phobia[^phobia] or a limiting
belief[^limiting-belief]?
- How do I change my subconcious, automatic reactions[^six-step]?

I'm sure, the way that I see NLP will expand, as continue on my NLP journey.

[^memory]: Sometimes I am haunted by something stupid I did, something
uncomfortable or something I saw that produces an undesired feeling.
I can decrease the intensity by making the picture smaller and pushing it
farther away, view it from a different perspective or make it go away with a
swish.
[^sound]: Sometimes I have caught a catchy sound or have some internal
dialogue that I don't like. I can just turn down the volume or stop it from
looping through a (imagined) control panel I have installed through Design
Human Engineering (DHE.)
[^desired-state]: You can create reusable anchors or circles of excellence
to get into a desired state.
NLP also gives you the tools to bringing about and intensifying any feeling
you'd like.
[^phobia]: For phobias, the quick phobia cure is usually best.
A swish or 6-step reframe can work better, if the fear is more general.
[^limiting-belief]: To get rid of limiting beliefs I usually use the 6-step
reframe or a parts negotiation.
[^six-step]: With a 6-step refame I go in an negotiate or convince a
subconscious part of mine to adjust it's behavior to be (more) in line
with what I want.

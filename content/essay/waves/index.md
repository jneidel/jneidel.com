{{<lead>}}
Everything flows in waves.
{{</lead>}}

Some weeks I feel defeated. Nothing goes my way.
Other weeks I am having the time of my life and am super productive.

Some days I feel super happy and everything goes my way.
Other days I have a hard time fighting off the temptations and can't live up
to what I wanted to do.

Some hours I'm not capable of doing anything and can only lie there.
Other hours I'm super focused and check one thing after the other off my
list.

Why is there such a huge variance in my performance and mood?

## The economic cycle

In economics there is a model that describes how an economy behaves.
According to it, the economy goes through these phases[^businesscycle]:

[^businesscycle]: It's called the "Boom and Bust Cycle" or the "[Business Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_cycle)".
1. Expansion: getting better
2. Boom: at it's best
3. Recession: getting worse
4. Depression: at it's worst
5. The cycle restarts with expansion
<!-- Wachstum, Aufschwung -->

The business cycle happens on different time frames.
You can zoom into yearly cycle, which might be in expansion, just to find it
to be made up of a weekly cycle.
The yearly expansion is made up of some better and worse weeks.
Around Christmas, for example, the economy is booming, followed by a
recession around new years, a depression in February and another expansion
as sales pick up again.

You can zoom in again and again to find the same cycle repeating itself and
the daily, hourly, etc. time frame.
Some days drive more sales than others.
Some hours see peak demand, some barely any.

## Applying the cycle

Back to the question from the beginning.
I think this model of the business cycle can also be applied to my
performance and mood[^perfmood].

[^perfmood]: I group performance and mood together, because to me, they are related.
If I can't perform/produce I usually don't feel so good either.

In the morning I'm in expansion. Waking up, water, breakfast and then I can
deliver peak performance.

## Cool story, bro

What the practical use of applying this model to your own performance?

### Spot downturns and be okay with them

Not always delivering peak performance is not only okay, but to be expected.
Be nice with yourself when you _can't_ perform.

Beating yourself up over not delivering will only make things worse.

### Analyze Recession/Depressions

- What makes them worse?
- What keeps you there?
- How can you minimize the damage?
- How can you bring about the expansion more quickly?
- What do your Recessions have in common with each other?
  Where are you? Who are you with? What are you eating? What are you doing?

### Analyze Expansion/Boom

- What makes them worse?
- What keeps you there?
- How can you maximally utilize them?
- What do your Expansions have in common with each other?
  Where are you? Who are you with? What are you eating? What are you doing?

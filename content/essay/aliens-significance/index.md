Aliens challenge our western worldview.
One dominated by a science based in the material world.
What lies beyond our senses is disregarded.
If you can't see, touch, feel, hear or smell it, it's not _real_.
{.dropcap}

There is some physical evidence to the phenomenon of alien abductions.
Enough to win over those who are prepared to believe.
But not enough to convince the skeptic.
As if the intelligence at work here was trying to trick and deceive the
investigators.
That might be on purpose.
It's as if the phenomenon was inviting us to change our ways, to expand
our consciousness and ways of learning.
A challenge to adapt our conventional ways of knowing and observing, to
find methodologies more appropriate to its own subtle, complex, and perhaps
ultimately unknowable nature.

_They_ are not of this world.
Why do we demand that our worldly thinking applies?
Our methods are insufficient to measure and evaluate phenomena that originate
in the unseen spirit world and cross over to manifest in the material world.
If you treat aliens and similar phenomena literally, you miss the message.
The medium _is_ the message.

I don't care about aliens or answering the question "Are _they_ real?"
I care about people;
The profound effect an alien abduction on had the people, who believe it
happened to them –
how it dramatically altered their lives for the better –
and the effect that investigating this phenomenon had on me.
It has compelled me to elevate my consciousness and to fight for and look
after our planet.

**For your study**

If you want to look into the topic yourself, I would recommend John Mack.
He has a sober, scientific style and approaches the material with an open
mind, but not as a true believer.
A [primer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SJUowifik).
His work [<cite>Abductions</cite>](https://amzn.to/40F2YQ1) details the raw experiences of Abductees.
In [<cite>Passport to the Cosmos</cite>](https://amzn.to/3Chw9PS) he describes the themes that continously come up in abductions.

The study of UFOs is not of interest to me.
It lacks the transformative potential for the individual and is dominated by
the distracting narrative that "the goverment is lying to us."
If you want to go there, I'd start with the documentary [<cite>The Phenomenon</cite>](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13095604).

Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
with video games I used to repeat a cycle over and over again.
It went like this: temptation, followed by a downward spiral where the games
suck me in more and more and everything else in my life falls into
disrepair, things get out of hand and I stop myself, uninstall and swear to
never touch video games again, then I repeat it from the start.

After the last time in my life that I played video games, something was
different though.
No big drama, I just knew I was done with it.
It was not something I did consciously.
The idea of it does not tempt me anymore.
I now feel a mix of contempt and disgust for it.

The video games are in the past, but with entertainment media I had a
similar cycle going just until this week.
Coming off my no media challenge, I lost two days to entertainment.
I had tried in the past to combat my desire for entertainment on an
analytical level: creating rules, restricting access, understanding what
lays behind it and banning it altogether for a time (= no media challenge.)
To no avail.
Despite making the experience that I was much better off without it, I would
always returned to it.

I think I successfully engineered a change similar to what I unconsciously
did with the video games.
I went into my unconscious and negotiated the decision to forsake
entertainment and wholeheartedly accept all that comes with it.
I have not been drawn to entertainment media since.
What I consumed habitually with entertainment as the intent, I quickly
aborted, because I found it to be dull and tasteless.
A great success indeed:slightly_smiling_face:

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- [Eat raw](/de/project/rohkost){{<de>}} at least until Mar01
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading)
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (8x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

- Eating raw is no problem at all.
Even in a social occasion I was not tempted by the non-raw food and bringing
my own food was fine too.
- I had and have some maintenance stuff to do, before I can jump into my
next trading focus challenge.

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Next one

**Don't judge my thoughts. Laugh at them and dismiss them.**

Most all of my thoughts are unhelpful and distract me from the moment.
To have one thought after the other, even though I keep dismissing them, can
be disheartening at times.
I would imagine that taking a more cheerful attitude by laughing at them
would help to improve my state and presence level.

## New articles

All the best,<br>

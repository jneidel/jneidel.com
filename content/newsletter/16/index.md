Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
I don't have an intro story prepared.
Sorry, folks.
Tune in again next week:wink:

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- [Eat raw](/de/project/rohkost){{<de>}} at least until Mar01
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading) (will pick this topic up next week)
- No media challenge until Jan10
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (7x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now).</small>

Last week I started a short focus challenge[^focus-challenge] to get into
the raw diet.
Which I did.
I already started eating raw and will continue to do so for at least two
months, probably more.

- Start eating raw<br>
  Which I did.
  See the [article](/de/project/rohkost){{<de>}} about the challenge and my motivations for doing this in the first place.
- Research what makes raw work<br>
  I answered some fundamental open questions I had about how this is
  supposed to work.
  There are still a lot of details open, but I will figure those out with
  time and practice.
- Compile own raw foods wiki with everything I know<br>
  I already started with this over at [/foods](/de/foods/){{<de>}} and will
  expand continuously. I need this for myself and I might as well make it
  public.

With this I'm almost done with my quick focus challenge.
I'll get back into trading shortly.
I have to take care of some maintenance tasks first.

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Last one

Last weeks challenge was: [No explaining](newsletter/15#next-one)

There were not many opportunities to practice this.
I did map out some if this, then that logic for how to react to different
people in scenarios that are bound to come up.
For example: "Why do you eat raw?", "What are you working on?" from a person
who is just trying to make conversation.

### On no media

After I got over the initial hurdle of the No Media Challenge, my desire for
the quick dopamine fix went down drastically.
It astonishes me every time how hard it is at first to stop consuming media
and then how easy it is to maintain it.

My personal problem with media is not about anything I consume in
particular.
It's about how it reprograms my mind to look for the easy dopamine hit.
I want the easy reward and become unwilling to do the hard work.

## New articles

- Project definition: [Eating raw experiment](/de/project/rohkost){{<de>}}
- My [definition of what eating raw means](/de/misc/rohkost-definition/){{<de>}} and why it makes sense to me
- Wrote a rundown of implementing a [technical documentation framework](dev/technical-documentation) at my job

All the best,<br>
Jonathan

Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
this week I was pondering this quote:

> Don't let the tail wag the dog.

An example of this would be copying a trading method just because it is
profitable, regardless of what it might entail.
It chooses profit over your priorities and personality.
You don't want to make yourself fit the method.
Make the method fit you.

A related saying is to "put the cart in front of the horse."
They are slightly different, but both are about mistaking the means for the
end.

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading)
- Focus challenge[^focus-challenge] on trading, until Dec19
- Don't buy sweets and such, until the end of the year
- Generate [10 ideas](newsletter/7#next-challenge) every day
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (4x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

My focus challenge[^focus-challenge] is coming to it's end.
With Christmas coming up and the markets slowing, I will mostly turn my
focus elsewhere until new years.

I will keep practice trading and do some writing over the holidays.

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Last one

While unannounced, last weeks challenge was: **Note down nothing**

It came as a logical conclusion of being more present.
Don't write down what I'm thinking.
Instead of engaging with thought (and thus giving it more room), just let
the thought go.
Most of it is nonsense anyway.

There were no adverse outcomes.
Just more presence and less notes to process in my weekly review.

All the best,<br>
Jonathan

Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
one of these evenings I was watching a movie with my wife.
At some point she gets up from the couch, because watching what's going to
happen it is too much for her.
She listens from nearby.
This is not an uncommon occurrence, but it always annoys me as I want to
cuddle.
Also I misinterpret it as a lack of interest in the movie (which it is not.)

Then shes asks me to pause the movie, she needs to do something real quick.
My initial reaction is annoyance and I think "You already got up, you
don't really want to watch this, why are you ruining my movie-watching
experience?"
But I just let those thoughts go and sat there patiently.

After ca. 7 mins she comes back.
We talk.
She had a legitimate reason why she needed me to pause.
She really did want to watch the movie with me.
My annoyed judgement was completely wrong.
It would have been destructive (to my mood and the relationship) had I let
it take over (like in the past.)

It was easy to patiently wait for her, because I was present.
I just sat there.
Being present and not resisting what is happening (I want to watch, but I
can't) led to much better outcomes than getting annoyed.
It helped me to [keep the vibe up](newsletter/11) and strengthened the trust
I have in my wife word.

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- [No media challenge](newsletter/4) until Jan10
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading)
- Generate [10 ideas](newsletter/7#next-challenge) every day
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (6x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

Over Christmas I spent most of my time with family and friends.
Even after I was back home it was hard to dive into the writing, like I had
planned.
I found myself craving the easy dopamine of media and unable to work on
anything substantial.
This is of course nothing unusual.
Usually I won't let it come this far, but Christmas messed with my timing on
my regular no media detox schedule.
Anyway, I'm doing no media now as I prepare things to launch into my next
focus challenge[^focus-challenge] (2-3 weeks on trading) sometime next week.

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Last one

Last weeks challenge was: [No arguing](newsletter/14#next-one)

I caught myself multiple times as the discussion was devolving into an
argument.
In all of the cases stopping was the correct path of action.
I noticed this about those arguments, they were:
1. About something I don't care about or there was no value in arguing
2. Arguing coincided with negative indicators (worse mood)

I'm sure I also had some conversations that could would fit the definition
of "arguing".
I did not notice (or categorize) them, probably because I instinctively
know the kind of ill-intentioned, bad faith argument I was targeting with
this challenge.

### Next one

Besides starting pointless arguments, I also often comment unasked on things I know
very little about.

I will do the **No explaining** challenge, or "Don't explain unless spoken to".[^play]

[^play]: Hopefully the play on "don't speak unless spoken to" is obvious
enough:slightly_smiling_face:

<details>
<summary>Challenge details</summary>

I will not explain:
- how X works/happens
- how I think/feel about X
- my reasons for doing/thinking X

I will not explain unasked.
And even if the other person asks me I will say "I don't know".
Exceptions apply (other person is very present, I it preface by saying "I heard
thatâ€¦", etc.)
Generally though: avoid explaining.

</details>

Why do this challenge?

- I don't know shit
- Most of the time I don't really know my own reasons for why I did things
- The vast majority of my thoughts are useless and not worth repeating
- I want to de-emphasize ego identification
- Most people care only about themselves, they don't really want to know
what I think

## New articles

I'll see what I can get done before starting the next focus challenge.

All the best,<br>
Jonathan

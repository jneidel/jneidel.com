Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
this was an unproductive week.
I found the culprit in a violation of one of my fundamental habits, which
are: 1) walk every day,[^walking] 2) stay present,[^present] 3) sleep 8h and get up around 5:15.[^sleep]
A day that lacks any of these is in trouble.
I was in violation of 3).
How did I come to fall asleep at 2:00?
I don't know:shrug:
Possibly a leftover from new years.
Either way, it was negligence on my part to keep it that way.

[^walking]: Walking serves as a mental reset for me.
Without it: I get headaches, my mind gets foggy and I become unfocused and
distracted by thought.
<br><br>
I first got introduced to the magic of walking every day because I was
searching for a cure to a minor back pain I had developed by being on the
computer all day. Walking did the trick.
[^present]: If I don't make an effort to be present, I will become stressed
and overwhelmed running after my thoughts.
I will be in a bad humor, more afraid (of doing the things I have to) and
will create or engage in unnecessary conflict.
[^sleep]: Without my 8h of sleep I can't perform and will engage in more
entertainment seeking, need to relax more and have a tendency to eat worse.
Without getting up between 5:00-6:00 I don't get to work during my most
productive hours and thus cripple my output.

For me, this served as a reminder of the importance those fundamental habits
have for my life and as a reaffirmation to stand my ground with them.
I've already taken corrective action by moving up my sleep cycle.[^cycle]

[^cycle]: One can only move their sleep cycle by 2h in either
direction per night, without incurring penalties.
Anything more will be a big disturbance to sleep quality, as your inner
clock fails to adequately adjust.

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- [Eat raw](/de/project/rohkost){{<de>}} at least until Mar01
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading)
- [Read one book at a time](newsletter/18#next-one) until Mar19
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (10x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

- I attempted to start the next focus challenge[^focus-challenge] on trading, but it
was like wading through slime.
So much resistance and distraction, despite clearing up all imagined
roadblocks before.
I will get on with this, when the time is right.
- I took my first steps into identifying wild herbs.
It's a lot of fun to get to know the plants growing around me!
Today, I was munching on these in the forest:

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Last one

Last weeks challenge was: [Read one book at a time](newsletter/18#next-one)

Finished the first book and have not started with a new one yet.
I felt that this restriction gave me a useful motivation to finish up the
topic and the book I was reading, as well as stopping me from diving
straight into a project I'm not sure I want to commit to.

I will report more finding over time.

### Next one

**Connect to the inner body** in the morning and to reconnect with that
connection through-out the day.

{{<details summary="'Inner body' explanation">}}
> To stay present in everyday life, it helps to be deeply rooted with-in
yourself; otherwise, the mind, which has incredible momentum, will drag you
along like a wild river. [To be rooted within yourself] means to inhabit
your body fully. To always have some of your attention in the inner energy
field of your body. To feel the body from within, so to speak. Body
awareness keeps you present. It anchors you in the Now.
<br><br>â€“ Eckart Tolle in <cite>[The Power of Now</cite>](https://amzn.to/4aAKcfS), beginning of Chapter 5
{{</details>}}

I have attempted this [before](newsletter/2#next-challenge) with mixed [results](newsletter/3#review-of-last-challenge).
I am coming back to it, because of the power inherent to the concept.
When I'm connected to my inner body, all of my thoughts seem ephemeral.
They are only passing through, they are not me.
I feel the separation between the thoughts and me, because I feel myself so
deeply underneath it all.
It does not like a return to the present after being distracted by thought,
but instead, like I never left, like I truly remained present through-out.

## New articles

As a result of my research, you're getting:
- [Why do aliens matter?](essay/aliens-significance) Regardless if they are real or not.

All the best,<br>

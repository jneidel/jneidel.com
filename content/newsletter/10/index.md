Since the last newsletter I wasn't unproductive.
Two out of those three weeks I consumed very little media, did a lot of
programming[^prog] and busied myself.
I noticed two things:

[^prog]: I had an intense day implementing [ES based search for my note-taking system](https://github.com/jneidel/org-search).
Besides that I worked on my Emacs setup, getting it to the point where I can
do more tasks from inside of it.

1. While programming, I displayed some of the same obsessive tendencies that
I dislike in consuming media (don't want to stop even though I should, I do
it instead of something else I promised to do, etc.)
The behavior is similar.
Only how I feel about the activity differs.
2. I worked on the wrong things.
My efforts where spent on a wide array of topics.
Whatever seemed relevant at the moment.
Most of it was unimportant and almost none of it aligned with my current
priority.

Last week, I started what I call a **focus challenge**, to address point
number two.
My subject in focus is developing a [stock market strategy](/de/project/börsenstrategie/){{<de>}}.
This was my _declared priority_ before, I just didn't work on it.

<details>
<summary>Focus challenge definition</summary>

I commit to work on a topic (a subject) for a period of time.
The leading principle is: Stay _on-topic_ at all times.
That means any task, project, action, media shall pertain pertain to the
selected topic.
Anything _off-topic_ is to be noted for later without receiving much
attention.

Exceptions apply for established habits, outside work, chores, <abbr title="Time with Friends, Family, Francis (my wife)">FFF</abbr>, etc.

Some applications of this principle:
- I hid all my off-topic projects.
- I only listed to on-topic audiobooks and podcasts.
- I only read on-topic books.
- I only listened to instrumental music.
- I did not process any off-topic notes in my note-taking system.
- I did not make any online purchases.
</details>

For this past week the challenge has already worked really well!

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now).</small>

I attended the first in a series of private lectures from Torsten Böttcher.
He teaches the stock market strategy he has been successfully utilzing for
some years.

Consequently I'm applying what I've learned (selling naked puts) in paper
trading[^paper].

[^paper]: Paper trading means I'm using the same software, but am not using
    real money.

I'm also developing my own type of trading journal in emacs org-mode.
As one great trader said:

> The fruits of your success will be in direct ratio to the honesty and
sincerity of your own effort in **keeping your own records**, doing your own
thinking, and reaching your own conclusions.
> – [Jesse Livermore](https://jesse-livermore.com/)

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments:
- Focus challenge until December 19th
- No buying sweets and such until the end of the year
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday, no matter what

I want to encourage you to call me out, if there is no Newsletter:smile:.
Stakes[^stakes] will be added soon<sup>:tm:</sup>.
[^stakes]: I'm thinking of something like a [Wikipedia pact](https://www.marcnitzsche.de/wikipedia-pacts/) or [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/).

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning/philosophy/trick for a week.</small>

### Last one

The last challenge was: [Applying data hierarchies](newsletter/9#next-challenge)

First up: I did not do _any_ of the tasks I listed.
I spent some time with each of them, but didn't take them to completion.
I will not do this kind of challenge in the future.
It neither worked for me nor this newsletter.

### Next one

**Don't react. Create!**

Instead of reacting automatically, I want to pause and choose to create
something.
A positive feeling, a relationship, an opportunity, a moment of presence.
Anything I want to create.

Quoting from [<cite>Crazy Good, by Steve Chandler</cite>](https://amzn.to/3Zn9JoQ):
<blockquote>
<h4>This guy needs to be taught a lesson</h4>

I receive a negative, nasty email.

Someone hates me. That’s my first thought.

So then I think revenge. How could I be hated? How can that be? My ego has to be
protected from that, even though I know, deep down, that my ego is, as Ken
Wilber says, kept in existence by a collection of emotional insults. Still. What
would be a clever put-down? How can I humiliate this idiot and show him he
should not be messing with me at this level, words against words?

This guy said he’d purchased one of my very first audio programs and it was
awful. It was worse than awful. My voice was so slow and monotonous he couldn’t
stand it.

“It made me want to kill myself,” he said.

Wow. That’s a heavy criticism.

So . . . How should I defend myself?

I start to compose a reply. I’ll tell him that only idiots want what he
wants—some ranting and raving motivational type guy who spits spittle from a red
face hyped with passion popping out of it. Some raving secular evangelist
selling a speed-rap of monetized passion.

I’ll say my audio is for thoughtful people, so I speak slowly. I’ll tell him I
put a lot of time into my words. I don’t want to insult the listener by sounding
like I’m in a shouting contest. I’ll say if you need to be motivated by the tone
of someone’s voice, by the urgency in their screeching throat, then you are in a
self-induced coma. You are not an awakened human being. Stay away from me or
I’ll have you locked up.

I back away from the keyboard before I send all that.

I see that I’m reacting.

I start to worry about how upset I’ve made myself and how it will impact the
work I have to do. I am now considering cancelling some of my work today. Then
my anger turns from hot to cold. I’ve worn myself out, mentally. I’ve descended
from wired-up to just mildly unraveled. I am slumping in my chair. I re-read his
words.

Then I realize I have a choice. **I don’t have to react** to this guy. **I can do the
opposite.**

If only I can remember the opposite.

**What is the opposite of reacting?** Oh, right! **Creating!** I can create. Reacting
and creating have the exact same letters in them. That helps me remember.

Deep breath. Okay. What do I want to create?

**How about I create a relationship?** Why not shoot for that? I could create a bond
with him, maybe, based on my desire to serve people. Am I shooting for the moon
with that? So what? President Kennedy got a lot of mileage out of shooting for
the moon.

But we’re not off to a good start, this guy and me, I have to acknowledge that.
Am I even sure he’s still alive? He said he felt like killing himself after
listening to me.

I’m sure that was just an expression. Okay. I will see what I can create.

So I write back. I decide to be completely honest.

I say, “Dear Harmon,” (because his name is Harmon) “I hear you. In fact, I agree
with you. My early recordings are just flat out bad. I think the current ones
are getting better, but I could be fooling myself. I have to say I appreciate
people like you who have the courage to reach out and tell me the truth. You are
helping me get better. I am sorry for your negative experience and I want to
make it up to you. If you send me your mailing address, I’ll send my two latest
books to you. You can read those to yourself at your own chosen speed. Thanks
for taking the time to communicate with me.”

This is my response to Harmon. A few days go by and I get an email from him:
“Well, that was unexpected. I must say you take criticism pretty well. Was I too
negative? I do like your books. Did I tell you that? I enjoy reading them.”

I send two books out to him. A relationship is being created. Created! In the
old days I would have just gone with my first reaction.[^p]

## New articles

I have concluded/aborted my [writing challenge](project/writing-365) and
rounded off the article accordingly.

I also played around with the format of this newsletter.
Like this, it was more fun for me to write and (hopefully for you to read:slightly_smiling_face:.)


All the best,<br>
Jonathan

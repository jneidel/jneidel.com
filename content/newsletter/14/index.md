Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
the last week did not feel productive.
The holidays loomed over my topic of focus.
I could not make a decision that I need to make.
The time and focus to research it and to follow through were not there.

I was torn between the end of the focus challenge and upcoming holidays.
I went from a narrow focus to diffuse exploration.

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- To [become profitable at trading](project/day-trading)
- Don't buy sweets and such, until the end of the year
- Publishing this newsletter every Sunday (5x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

Nothing much over the Christmas holidays.
In the past I used to plan a bunch of stuff to work on while I was with my
family.
It always frustrated me.
For some reason or another I would fall way behind what was planned.

Before the end of the year I want to publish all the half-done articles and a
few other ones.
I will work on that in the mornings (which I have to myself.)

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Next one

For next week I will do **No Arguing**.

I will not engage in argument, combatitive discussion or negotation.
I won't fight for my viewpoint or against the somebody elses.

The aim is to be less identified with what "I believe."
"My opinions" are a tool of the ego to disconnect me from other people and I
want to foster that connection instead.

**Timing:**

The is the ideal time for the challenge.
A combination of being around people (I will want to argue) and not being at
my job (I'm not taking my ability away to contribute at work.)

**Rules:**
- I can say Yes/No to something
- I can propose an alternative
  - I will not argue the merit of my option/opinion/plan
  - I will not argue the flaws/dismerit of the others option/opinion/plan

**Expectations:**
- More harmony
- Other people will perceive me as more charming and warm
- I feel less ego driven and judgemental
- Ocasionally we get worse outcomes, because I did not fight for the
"best" outcome

All the best,<br>
Jonathan

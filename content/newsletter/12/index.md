Hi :slightly_smiling_face:,<br>
two big things happened for me this week:

1. A decision about [day trading](project/day-trading)

After playing with the idea [last week](newsletter/11), I now made a decision.
I will seriously dedicate myself to make day trading work.
This is my new all-encompassing focus.
See the full [write-up](project/day-trading).

2. Unlocking more presence

I did an [NLP](misc/what-is-nlp) technique to investigate any mental
barriers to being more present.
I already had two challenges over the course of this newsletter to try to
improve in this area.
I found a significant roadblock.
In essence I had to decide if I wanted to be more present.
To accept everything that comes along with it.
Making that decision I reconfigured my subconscious and got instant[^instant] (and
lasting) results.
I got a markedly increased sensation of presence and some other goodies.

## Commitments

My ongoing commitments are:
- To [become profitable at day trading](project/day-trading)
- Focus challenge[^focus-challenge] on trading, until Dec19
- Don't buy sweets and such, until the end of the year
- Generate [10 ideas](newsletter/7#next-challenge) every day
  <br>Favorite from last week: 10 ideas to make my life 1% better in 5 mins
- Publish this newsletter every Sunday (3x streak:sunglasses:)

## What I'm working on
<small>For context, see [/now](now#projects).</small>

Due to my focus challenge[^focus-challenge], everything I'm working on is
about trading.

- **trade** [**day trading strategy**](project/day-trading)<br>
  It was exciting to be in the markets. I did the first few trades. Getting
familiar with the strategy I'm using.
- **research & deliberate trading practice**
  <small>See day trading.</small>
- **do internal analysis**
  <small>See day trading.</small><br>
  I have adjusted my behavior to be more present while staring at the chart
and to not be greedy about unrealized profits.
- **trade** [**options strategy**](/de/project/b√∂rsenstrategie/){{<de>}}<br>
  I got a good hit rate on paper[^hr]. Seems promising so far.
- **improve trading journal**<br>
  Added the capacity to [accumulate important metrics in one place](https://github.com/jneidel/dotfiles/commit/f04d7e8eaec7491c1083500d173dc547adbb79af)  (hit rate, P/L both global and by trade type) and more.
  At this point it works well enough that I can turn my attention elsewhere.

## Challenges
<small>Applying a specific learning or philosophy for a week ([see project](project/challenges).)</small>

### Last one

Last weeks challenge was: [Keeping the vibe up](newsletter/11#next-one)

I found it a helpful reminder about how important my current state really is
in everything I do.
It has been adopted into my personal philosophy.

### Next one

Nothing particularly caught my eye.
Skipping for this week.

### On previous challenges

I've been tracking how my morning routine (get out of bed with alarm and
stretching) is correlated with my outcomes (how I felt and what intensity I
brought to my work.)
As part of this I looked at my awareness, my level of presence during
stretching.

I have made it a rule to continue stretching until I'm in the present.
The days when I'm not is when I need it the most.
Where otherwise I would bring those scattered and distracted thoughts into
my next task.

## New articles

about? What is motivation?

All the best,<br>

[^focus-challenge]: {{<glossary/focus-challenge>}}
[^hr]: The number is 85%, but some of those trades were tests. I don't take
this number so seriously.
[^instant]: Not literally instant. It took 10-20 mins. Which is still pretty
quick considering the change.

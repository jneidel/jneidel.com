I have decided to commit myself and take my writing to the next level.
The challenge is: 365 days of writing every day.

No off-days. No excuses.

## Intent

I want to get better at writing.
Doing something every day is a very effective way of getting better at
something.

I have a vision of this website in my mind that I want to bring to life.
That requires a lot of writing.
I want to spend this time working through my huge backlog of articles and
build traction for this site.

I thoroughly enjoyed writing my thesis in uni and have known since
that I want to make this practice a regular part of my life.

## Definition of Writing

I am a person that needs clear rules.
Uncertainty about what I can and can't do leads me to indecision and abusing loopholes.

- §1 Writing means writing something that will be used on this website.
- §2 **The minimum is one usable paragraph.**
It does not matter if the paragraph ends up being used.
The intention should be that it will be.
A note or rough draft does not count.
    + a) Process-appropriate _translation_ work is a suitable alternative.
**The minimum for translation is a whole article**.
    + b) Late-stage _editing_ is another alternative.
**The minimum for editing is bringing an article from the editing phase to publication.**
- §3 Writing needs to happen on some article that is in the pipeline, not
just: "Oh yeah, I wrote this note that will become an article later."

## Updates

Here I will keep a daily log of what I have written (updated weekly.)

## Learnings
### Progress

I can feel that I'm getting better at writing.

Structuring posts is becoming easier.
First drafts are becoming better.
Editing is becoming faster.
I have a better sense of what won't and will fit.
The distinction between English/German has become more clear.
I don't mix the two together as much and both sound more organic.
I'm better at writing clear, short sentences.
At omitting unneeded words.
I pick up and improve little stylistic elements, like quoting a source, use
of footnotes, parenthesis for explanations, headline interaction with the
text before and after, etc.

This outcome was expected, but it is still satisfying to see this happen
organically, without conscious focus.

### Comprehension & Completion

The ideas and projects I pick to write about are usually very thought-out.
I have already engaged with them, internalized and applied them to my life.

What I find in writing about them is that they were not as clear in my mind
as I had thought.
There are aspects I overlooked.
Discrepancies that reveal themselves.
Questions I can't answer, that pop into my head.

Writing forces me to clearly structure everything I know on the topic in my
mind.

It also makes me really complete a project.
I go through my messy notes and create a beautifully shaped article out of
them.
One that put the core ideas are front and center.
That lacks the unimportant references and tangents (side notes.)
That is clearly structured and referenceable.

### When I otherwise wouldn't

There were many days that I sat down to write in the evening just because I
had to.
This challenge forced me to do the right thing, when I otherwise wouldn't.

Sometimes I would write very little.
That's ok.
I made the bar (required minimum) very low on purpose.
I still did the writing and kept up the habit.

Sometimes I was not in the mood.
I still sat down to write and discovered that it was a lot of fun.
It always is.

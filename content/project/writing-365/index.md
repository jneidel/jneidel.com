## Challenge definition

I have decided to commit myself and take my writing to the next level.
The challenge is: 365 days of writing every day.

No off-days. No excuses.

This challenge was inspired by Andy: [CHALLENGE: Start a 365 Day Project](https://killyourinnerloser.com/challenge-start-a-365-day-project/) and
a this [more in-depth podcast episode](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/kill-your-inner/365-day-projects-are-amazing-ZgEoY2xBrJk/).

### Intent

I want to get better at writing.
Doing something every day is a very effective way of getting better at
something.

I have a vision of this website in my mind that I want to bring to life.
That requires a lot of writing.
I want to spend this time working through my huge backlog of articles and
build traction for this site.

I thoroughly enjoyed writing my thesis in uni and have known since
that I want to make this practice a regular part of my life.

### Definition of Writing

I am a person that needs clear rules.
Uncertainty about what I can and can't do leads me to indecision and abusing loopholes.

- §1 Writing means writing something that will be used on this website.
- §2 **The minimum is one usable paragraph.**
It does not matter if the paragraph ends up being used.
The intention should be that it will be.
A note or rough draft does not count.
    + a) Process-appropriate _translation_ work is a suitable alternative.
**The minimum for translation is a whole article**.
    + b) Late-stage _editing_ is another alternative.
**The minimum for editing is bringing an article from the editing phase to publication.**
- §3 Writing needs to happen on some article that is in the pipeline, not
just: "Oh yeah, I wrote this note that will become an article later."

## Learnings
### Progress

I can feel that I'm getting better at writing.

Structuring posts has become easier.
First drafts are better.
Editing is faster.
I have a better sense of what won't and will fit.
The distinction between English/German has become more clear.
I don't mix the two together as much and both sound more natural.
It's easier to write clear short sentences.
To omit unneeded words.
I pick up and improve little stylistic elements, like: quoting a source, the
us of footnotes, parenthesis for explanations, headline interaction with the
text before and after, etc.

This outcome was expected, but it is still satisfying to see this happen
organically, just by sitting down to do the work.

### Comprehension & Completion

The ideas and projects I pick to write about are usually very thought-out.
I have already engaged with them, internalized and applied them to my life.

What I find in writing about them is that they were not as clear in my mind
as I had thought.
There are aspects I overlooked.
Discrepancies that reveal themselves.
Questions I can't answer, that pop into my head.

Writing forces me to clearly structure everything I know on the topic in my
mind.

It also makes me really complete a project.
I go through my messy notes and create a beautifully shaped article out of
them.
One that put the core ideas are front and center.
That lacks the unimportant references and tangents (side notes.)
That is clearly structured and referenceable.

### When I otherwise wouldn't

There were many days that I sat down to write in the evening just because I
had to.
This challenge forced me to do the right thing, when I otherwise wouldn't.

Sometimes I would write very little.
That's ok.
I made the bar (required minimum) very low on purpose.
I still did the writing and kept up the habit.

Sometimes I was not in the mood.
I still sat down to write and discovered that it was a lot of fun.
It always is.

## Challenge conclusion

The [last two months](#daily-log) of this challenge were on and off.
I was not really committed to the challenge any more.
The big reason for this was:
In my mind I had already already the goal behind this challenge.
Only the arbitrary time restriction kept it alive.

**My writing has improved.**
Anytime I want to write about a topic, I can pop out an article up to my
quality standard.
All the processes are in place, I know how to arrange the filter the
contents and describe the topic in a compelling way.
Certainly, there is still much room for improvement, especially when it
comes to moving a reader to action.
It is a topic I will focus on again in the future.

**The website has a decent amount of content.**
When I started this website, I only had ideas of how things would work.
I didn't have the articles to fill my categories.
I didn't know if it would make sense.
Now I do.
To me, the concept has been validated and realized.
A website can always have more articles and I have more to say.
And I will. With time.

**Future grow of the website does not hinge on more content.**
Articles are a factor, but SEO alone will not do it for me.
Instead I would have to market the website and spend time on growing an
audience.
That, combined with a focus on putting out more articles is most likely a
future priority.

With these point in mind, my focus naturally shifted.
Other topic come into focus and supplanted writing.
It became an annoyance on my todo list.
I still like writing and this was fun, but I now have [other things](now) I
am focused on.
These challenges needs to be in line with my priorities, not the other way
around.

Future writing for this website:
- I will continue to publish the [newsletter](newsletter) every week.
- I will try to publish one article every other week.
- The articles will be about topics I am currently working through.

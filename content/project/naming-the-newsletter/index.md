## What?

I needed a name for my newsletter.
It being called "Newsletter" just wouldn't do.
That "name" was a relict of <q>Start before you are ready.</q>

## Why?

> Words mean things.

The best names convey an essence of what lay beyond.
"The Power of Now" is about the energy of the present moment, "The 4-Hour
Workweek" about the idea that you can work dramatically less, "Using your
Brain –– For a change" about making your neurology work for you.

_"Newsletter"_ is just a category descriptor.
What it conveys is: generic, unoriginal, lazy, etc.

Simply, a fitting name for my newsletter would improve the perception of is
contained inside.

## How?

I generated 10[^10ideas] ideas everyday, until I had a good
selection (inspired by James Altuchers [idea generation practice](newsletter/7#next-challenge).)

### My list of ideas

Below you can find the raw list of what I came up with.
Feel free to skip it.
Some of these are awful, but I needed to get those out of my system, to get
at the better ones that will come after.

</details>

[^10ideas]: I wasn't so fixated on the number. My target was 12, but some
    days I left it at less than that.

### Effects

Thinking of names confronted me with the questions of: What am I doing with
the newsletter? What does it stand for? How can I capture that in a word? Or
an image?

### Themes

To me, the newsletter is about continuous personal development and growth.

The three images I came up with that embodied this were:
- Walking a winding path. Progress has it's twists and turns but you just
have to keep going and you will make it to the end. The path not
straight-forward and differs for each individual. We're all own our own
journey.
- A river flowing downstream. The river flows continuously.
The water that it is made up of has a lot of power.
The river _will_ make it's own way.
- A (sun)flower waving in the wind (see my logo.) The winds might blow in
this or that direction, but the flower remains stoic.
The flower needs to keep growing or it will wither away, it goes through
it's own lifes journey.

### Picking a winner

I went through and picked a selection of contenders (bolded in the list
above), which I weeded down to five candidates.

- Flowing towards Transformation
- A Winding Path of Progress
- Changing for the Better
- Winding up Better
- Wafting Winds of Change

With input from my wife, I decided on **A Winding Path of Progress**, which
had been my favorite picture all along.

### Tools used

Because I played around with alliterations, I created myself a list of nouns
to reference what I wanted the newsletter to symbolize.

- challenge
- progress
- evolution
- development
- change
- growth
- momentum
- enhancement
- transformation
- shift

I expanded this list by looking through
[Synonyms](https://www.thesaurus.com) and having [Claude](ai) generate me a
noun with a similar meaning, but starting with the letter X.

Also: [Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/) for definitions.

### Creating a logo

I had already envisioned a logo to go along with this title while I
conceived it.
I wanted a twisting road making its way into the horizon.
To an [image generation AI](ai) I went.
This was my prompt:

```
winding path into the distance drawn in fine red line #d70000 on white background, minimalistic simple, no scenery
```

{{<figure src="./original.jpeg" class="w-8/12" alt="The original version of the logo" caption="The original version image.">}}

After some editing in [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) (the linux photoshop), I had this final result:

{{<figure src="./result.png" class="w-7/12" alt="The final result of the logo" caption="The resulting logo on the website.">}}

I added some logic to my website, where on `/newsletter` routes it would
display this logo, rather than my normal sunflower.
[Here is the code](https://github.com/jneidel/jneidel.com/commit/97c61f9943d4632913ed2c4c3cc6edbdd97e39ec#diff-b25dcd1691733aecbe70f1ec2c608fd30fa37fcb25951b719d06913b5ed53d4d)
of how I did that in my hugo setup.

## Conclusion

This was fun and easy to do.
The method of generating many ideas over time worked very well for me.

<strong>effective</strong> … to do the correct thing.

<br>

In contrast to:

<br>

<strong>efficient</strong> … to do something correctly.

<br>
<br>

You can be efficient, but ineffective: very proficient at doing something, which will not yield the desired outcome.<br>
You can be effective, but inefficient: identified what will yield the desired outcome, but not (yet) very proficient at the activity.

<br>
<br>

Be effective first, then efficient.

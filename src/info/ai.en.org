#+description: How AI is used in the creation of this website.

This is a [[https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto][/ai page]].
It gives you an honest and detailed overview of how AI and LLMs are used in the
creation of this website.

*My promise:
The writing on this website will always be my own.*
It will never be fully or partially generated by an LLM.

** 2026 to present
| Area                    | LLM usage                            | Models       |
| Writing                 | No                                   |              |
| Editing (writing)       | No                                   |              |
| Article idea generation | No                                   |              |
| Translations            | No                                   |              |
| Cover thumbnails        | Generated by AI, edited by me        | ChatGPT      |
| Images in the article   | No                                   |              |
| Coding                  | Drafted by and refined with an agent | OpenAI Codex |

I [[https://github.com/jneidel/jneidel.com/commit/cacbb20cee94018bfe4975a0effb165edba51dd1][plan to experiment]] with agentic models to catch errors while editing.

** 2024 to 2025
| Area                    | LLM usage                     | Models             |
| Writing                 | No                            |                    |

| Article idea generation | No                            |                    |
| Translations            | No                            |                    |
| Cover thumbnails        | Generated by AI, edited by me | Microsoft Designer |
| Images in the article   | No                            |                    |
| Coding                  | As input for debugging        |                    |

I tested Claude, ChatGPT and [[https://www.deepl.com/write][DeepL Write]] to give me input while editing or help with translations.
I did not adopt them into my workflow and the contributions were microscopic.

** 2017 to 2024
No AI usage 🙂
